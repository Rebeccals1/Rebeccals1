## Welcome! 👋
My name is <strong>Rebecca L. Smith</strong>, I'm a Computer Science student at Cal Poly Pomona. My journey started as a self-taught graphic designer, driven by a love for turning ideas into visual stories. Over the years, balancing full-time parenting, freelance design work, and college has challenged me to grow in ways I never imagined—teaching me resilience, focus, and the value of creating with purpose.

As I tackled new projects and responsibilities, I discovered that what excites me most is building interactive experiences people can connect with and enjoy. That realization led me to software development—a field where I could combine creativity with logic, imagination with structure. Now, I’m passionate about blending my background in design with the technical skills I'm developing, crafting thoughtful, engaging solutions that make a difference in people's everyday lives.
