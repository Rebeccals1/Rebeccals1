## Welcome! 👋
My name is <strong>Rebecca L. Smith</strong>, I'm currently attending California Polytechnic State University Pomona and I'm majoring in Computer Science. My professional journey began as a self-taught graphic designer, where I developed a strong ability to create visually appealing designs to engage viewers. Along the way, I balanced work, college and the responsibilities of being a full-time parent. Over time, my career evolved as I discovered that my passion for transforming ideas into something more meaningful was better realized through software. That's why I've decided to dedicate myself to software development going forward.
