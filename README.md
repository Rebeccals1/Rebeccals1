## Welcome! 👋
<strong>Rebecca L. Smith</strong> is a Computer Science student at Cal Poly Pomona, but her path into tech has been anything but traditional. She began as a self-taught graphic designer, balancing full-time parenting and freelance design work while attending college—an experience that pushed her to grow, adapt, and find her voice.

Along the way, she discovered a deeper passion: building interactive experiences that people genuinely enjoy. Today, she’s combining her creative roots with software development to craft thoughtful, engaging applications that reflect both her artistic background and technical skills.
