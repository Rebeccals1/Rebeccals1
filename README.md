## Welcome! 👋
Hi, my name is <strong>Rebecca</strong>.

I’m a Computer Science student at Cal Poly Pomona. My path here has been anything but traditional. I began as a self-taught graphic designer, balancing full-time parenting and freelance design work while also attending college — an experience that pushed me to grow, adapt, and find my voice. Along the way, I discovered a deeper passion: building interactive experiences that people genuinely enjoy playing. I’m now combining my creative roots with software development to craft thoughtful, engaging applications that reflect both sides of who I am.
